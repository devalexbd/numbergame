# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple game created using JavaScript.
A random number is generated in the background when the user clicks the "START" button. The user must then use the input box and "GUESS" button to try and figure out what the random number is.

If the number is too low, blue text will appear saying "TOO LOW". If it's too high, the same will happen but with orange text. The user will have 3 attempts to try and guess the number until they receive a game over.

When the user gets a game over, they will be unable to continue the game until they press the "RESET" button or refresh the page.

(There is also a super secret button at the bottom that will reveal the random number.)

This project was part of my time on the Iungo Solutions Software Development bootcamp. We were tasked with creating this game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
